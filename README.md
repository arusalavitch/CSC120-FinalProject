# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

 The project was tackled by initially making a basic game plan, and listing out possible ideas, or layouts of the game map. Then files were made for each part of the game, like for each room, puzzle, commands for gerbil, etc. The final part was putting it all together and having each file implement other parts of our main file.  

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

 If we had unlimited time, we could possibly expand the map even more and add additional games for the gerbil to play. Also, we could implement a health feature where the gerbil has to act smartly and preserve its health, including finding food, water, etc.
