**Project Proposal: The Great Gerbil Escape**

**Premise:**
"The Great Gerbil Escape" is a text-based adventure RPG that follows the journey of a clever gerbil named Peanut who lives in a college student's dorm room. Tired of the monotony of cage life, Peanut hatches a plan to escape and explore the world beyond his cage. Players will navigate through various challenges and puzzles as Peanut embarks on his daring adventure.

**Main Character:**
Peanut, the gerbil, is the main character of the game. He is resourceful, curious, and determined to explore the unknown territories beyond his cage.

**Objective:**
Peanut's objective is to break out of his cage and explore the dorm room, solving puzzles, overcoming obstacles, and finding a way to freedom. Along the way, he aims to discover the secrets of the dorm room and uncover hidden treasures.

**Starting Point and End Goal:**
The game begins inside Peanut's cage, where he feels trapped and yearns for freedom. The ultimate destination for Peanut is to find a way out of the cage and into the dorm room, where he can roam freely and embark on his adventure.

**Objects, Skills, and Achievements:**
Throughout the game, Peanut will need to collect various objects, such as keys, tools, and food, to aid in his escape and exploration. He may also need to gain skills such as stealth and problem-solving to overcome obstacles and outsmart the human inhabitants of the dorm room. Achievements could include successfully navigating through challenging puzzles, discovering hidden passages, and ultimately achieving freedom outside the cage.

**Big Idea:**
The project aims to create an immersive text-based adventure RPG that combines elements of puzzle-solving, exploration, and narrative storytelling. Players will experience the world through Peanut's eyes, navigating through intricate scenarios and unraveling the mysteries of the dorm room.

**Building Blocks:**
- Narrative Design: Crafting a compelling storyline with engaging characters and plot twists.
- Puzzle Mechanics: Designing challenging puzzles and obstacles for players to solve.
- Text-Based Interface: Implementing a user-friendly interface for players to interact with the game environment.
- Object Interaction System: Developing a system for players to pick up, use, and interact with objects within the game world.

**Current Progress and Roadblocks:**
We have expertise in narrative design and are proficient in developing text-based interfaces. However, we still need to figure out the intricacies of puzzle mechanics and object interaction systems to ensure a smooth gameplay experience. Potential roadblocks include balancing difficulty levels, maintaining player engagement, and optimizing the user interface for various platforms.
